# Peto-s-Paradox-Research-Idea
Computational Design and Stability Analysis of Putative MDM2 Inhibitors Inspired by Loxodonta africana TP53 Isoforms


After learning about Peto’s paradox: the observation that elephants exhibit significantly lower cancer incidence than expected despite their large body size and long lifespan — potentially due to their expanded copy number of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 (which encodes the p53 transcription factor), whereas humans possess a single TP53 gene, I decided to explore in-silico de novo protein design using NVIDIA’s BioNeMo platform to develop hypothetical protein binders that could function as computationally proposed MDM2 inhibitors aimed at restoring p53 activity for potential anti-cancer applications.
