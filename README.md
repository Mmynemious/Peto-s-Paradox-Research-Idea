# Peto's-Paradox-Research-Idea
Peto’s paradox describes the observation that elephants exhibit a markedly lower cancer incidence than expected given their large body size and long lifespan. One proposed biological explanation involves the presence of multiple TP53 retrogenes in Loxodonta africana, which are thought to enhance apoptotic sensitivity by stabilizing canonical p53 and attenuating its degradation rather than acting as independent transcription factors.

In contrast, humans possess a single canonical TP53 gene and lack functional TP53 retrogenes, rendering p53 activity more susceptible to negative regulation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Inspired by the evolutionary apoptotic amplification mechanisms observed in elephants, this project explores the in-silico design of hypothetical protein or peptide binders capable of disrupting the p53–MDM2 interaction.

Using computational protein structure prediction, generative sequence design, and stability analysis frameworks analogous to those implemented in NVIDIA’s BioNeMo platform, this study aims to propose putative MDM2-binding constructs that could stabilize human p53 in silico, providing a proof-of-concept for evolution-inspired p53 regulatory modulation.
