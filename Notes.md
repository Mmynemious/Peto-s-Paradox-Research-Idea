# 1. The human p53 N-terminal peptide (residues 17–29, sequence ETFSDLWKLLPE) was selected because this region contains the core MDM2-binding motif. Residue numbers are critical: although full-length p53 is 393 amino acids, only residues 17–29 make direct contact with MDM2, as confirmed in the crystal structure PDB 1YCR. This ensures that any designed peptide or binder targets the biologically relevant interface for stabilizing p53.


# 2. Elephant residue: ETFSYLWELLP
To match length and mimic human p53 interactions, we can add 1–2 residues at the N- or C-terminus: M-ETFSYLWELLP-L

# 3. Check hydrophobic/polar positioning
MDM2 hotspots = Leu54, Leu57, Ile61, Tyr67, Phe91, Val93
Peptide design strategy:
- Hydrophobic residues (L, I, F, W) point toward hydrophobic pocket
- Polar residues (S, T, E) face solvent or form H-bonds
- Example final 13-residue peptide (elephant-inspired):

# METFSYLWELLPQ

- Hydrophobic residues: F, Y, L, W, L, L
- Polar residues: E, S, T, Q
